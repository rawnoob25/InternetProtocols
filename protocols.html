  		<h2>DHCP</h2>
  		<div class = 'protocol_content'>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>To give a host on a network an IPv4 address</p>
			<h3>Procedure</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><span style = 'font-weight: bold;'>DHCP DISCOVER:</span> Host sends a limited broadcast to either IPV4 address 255.255.255.255 or to MAC address FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF.</li>
				<li><span style = 'font-weight: bold;'>DHCP OFFER:</span> DHCP server on network (if present) responds to the broadcast and other hosts on network ignore the broadcast. The response includes a suggested IP address for the soon-to-be DHCP client. This response is the DHCP offer.</li>
				<li><span style = 'font-weight: bold'>DHCP REQUEST:</span> DHCP client sends message to DHCP server accepting the IP address provided to it.</li>
				<li><span style = 'font-weight:bold'>DHCP ACK:</span> DHCP server acknowledges receipt of the DHCP client's DHCP request.</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Other Considerations</h3>
			<p>
			In large corporate networks there's usually PC that functions as a DHCP server. In smaller corporate networks and in home networks, a router usually functions as a DHCP server for hosts on the network, and it's in turn a DHCP client for an ISP's DHCP server.
			</p>
			<div class = 'clarify'>Are DHCP requests from hosts on a home network sent to the router and then forwarded to the ISP's DHCP server? Is it the ISP's DHCP server that ultimately sends the host the DHCP ACK?</div>

			<p>In situations where a host on a network doesn't have an IP address, it assigns itself an IP address whose first couple octets are <span style = 'font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;'>169.254</span>; This is called an <span style = 'font-weight: bold;'>Automatic Private IP Address (APIPA)</span>; the host may lack an ip address due to any of the following: 
				<ul>
					<li>It's been set up for manual IP configuration and was never given an IP address. </li>
					<li>It has no associated DHCP server.</li>
					<li>It has not sent a valid DHCP request to its DHCP server.</li>
				</ul>

		<h2>ARP</h2>
		<div class = 'protocol_content'>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>When a device on the network wants to know another device's MAC address but does not, yet it knows the other device's IPv4 address, ARP allows the requesting device to obtain the MAC address of the other device. This is useful when a device needs to send a packet to another device on the local network (or needs to send the packet to the default gateway for transfer to another network), as the OSI layer 2 ethernet protocol cannot be completed without a valid destination MAC address.</p>
			<h3>Procedure</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><span style = 'font-weight: bold;'>ARP Request:</span> Host 1 (seeking the MAC address of Host 2) sends a limited broadcast to 255.255.255.255 (encapsulated in ethernet frame with destination MAC address FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF) asking device with ip address matching that stated in encapsulated data field of ethernet frame to send it (Host 1) its (the device w/ matching ip address) MAC address.</li>
				<li><span style = 'font-weight: bold;'>ARP Reply:</span> Host 2 replies with its MAC address and all other hosts ignore the message.</li>
				<li><span style = 'font-weight: bold;'>ARP cache update:</span> Host 1 updates its ARP table (ARP table is a mapping on any device of IPV4 addresses to MAC addresses for every device in that network)</li>
